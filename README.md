# ALX Higher Level Programming Projects

This repository showcases my progress and projects developed during the ALX Africa Higher Level Programming program. I primarily focus on Python, delving into advanced concepts, practical applications, and cross-cutting technologies.

## Key Skill Areas

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Designing and utilizing classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Implementing efficient data structures and applying appropriate algorithms for problem-solving.
* **Web Scraping:** Extracting and processing data from websites.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Ensuring code quality and reliability through testing.
* **Project Development:** Building real-world Python-based solutions.
